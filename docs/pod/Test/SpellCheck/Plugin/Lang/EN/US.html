<p>This <a href="/pod/Test/SpellCheck.html" class="podlinkpod"
>Test::SpellCheck</a> plugin provides the US English dictionary for checking spelling. It is a primary dictionary, so it shouldn&#39;t be used with other primary dictionaries.</p>

<p>This distribtion comes bundled with files from the SCOWL (And Friends) project, which is copyright under these terms (some of these terms are for other English language dictionaries from the SCOWL project, which are not bundled with this dist):</p>

<p>The English dictionaries come directly from SCOWL and is thus under the same copyright of SCOWL. The affix file is a heavily modified version of the original english.aff file which was released as part of Geoff Kuenning&#39;s Ispell and as such is covered by his BSD license. Part of SCOWL is also based on Ispell thus the Ispell copyright is included with the SCOWL copyright.</p>

<p>Alan Beale &#60;biljir@pobox.com&#62; also deserves special credit as he has, in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.</p>

<p>The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk&#39;s &#34;UK English Wordlist with Frequency Classification&#34;.</p>

<p>The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:</p>

<p>The &#34;UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification&#34; is also in the Public Domain:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
  From: Brian Kelk &#60;Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk&#62;

  &#62; I was wondering what the copyright status of your &#34;UK English
  &#62; Wordlist With Frequency Classification&#34; word list as it seems to
  &#62; be lacking any copyright notice.

  There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
  &#34;copyright&#34; was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
  source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
  PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
  domain.

  Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100

  &#62; So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?

  That is the intention.</pre>

<p>The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian&#39;s word list.</p>

<p>The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package. All words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via my inflection database.</p>

<p>The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.</p>

<p>The 40 level includes words from Alan&#39;s 3esl list found in version 4.0 of his 12dicts package. Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the public domain.</p>

<p>The 50 level includes Brian&#39;s frequency class 1, words appearing in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12 dictionaries. A decent number of proper names is also included: The top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added myself. Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in other word lists is included.</p>

<p>The name files form the Census report is a government document which I don&#39;t think can be copyrighted.</p>

<p>The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the &#34;Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists&#34; which is derived from &#34;The Jargon File&#34;. All of which is in the Public Domain. This file also contain a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file &#34;unix-terms&#34; in the special/ directory.</p>

<p>The 55 level includes words from Alan&#39;s 2of4brif list found in version 4.0 of his 12dicts package. Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also in the public domain.</p>

<p>The 60 level includes all words appearing in at least 2 of the 12 dictionaries as indicated by the 12Dicts package.</p>

<p>The 70 level includes Brian&#39;s frequency class 0 and the 74,550 common dictionary words from the MWords package. The common dictionary words, like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections added. The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of the 12Dics package which is in the public domain.</p>

<p>The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the &#34;UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary&#34; (UKACD), the list of signature words from the YAWL package, and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.</p>

<p>The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper &#60;thegrendel@theriver.com&#62;, is in the Public Domain:</p>
